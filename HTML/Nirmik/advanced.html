    <h4>Advanced Technology</h4>
    <p>The digital or software technologies that assist and helps the patients, physicians and the health organisations like hospitals and research institutes in various forms are healthcare technology.
    In 2022 as the internet and technology are booming, numerous health technologies are emerging to assist both patients and healthcare providers.</p>

    <h3> Remote Healthcare</h3>
    <p>Remote healthcare is also known as telehealth. Telehealth is one of the current medical technologies used widely across the world.

    <h3>Nanomedicine</h3>
    <p>Nanomedicine is defined as the use of nanoparticles or nano-objects like nanorobots or any other nanoscale materials in the medical industry.

    Nanomedicine is one of the most promising medical fields in future. Nanomedicine is so helpful in target drug injection and cancer treatment.
        
    Organisations use Nanopill cameras to study the inner parts of the body. In the coming years, the use of nanotechnology in the medical field will only increase. The nanomedicine industry is predicted to hit a market of over 125 billion dollars by 2024.</p><br>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>These 8 are the best healthcare technology trends that will change the face of the healthcare industry.
