	<h1>MANGO</h1>
	<p> mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It is believed to have originated between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.<br>

    Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.[1] Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines,[5][6] while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh</p><br>

    <h3>What kind of fruit is a mango?</h3><hr>
    <h2>stone fruit</h2>
<p>Botanically, mango is a drupe, consisting of an outer skin, a fleshy edible portion, and a central stone enclosing a single seed – also called stone fruit, like a plum, cherry, or peach.In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m (20 ft), with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor roots penetrating deeply into the soil.The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres (6–14 inches) long, and 6–16 cm (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature.The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild, sweet fragrance.Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known,many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop.The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening.</p><br><br><hr>

<h3>Where is mango originally from?</h3><hr>
<p>Mangoes came from India more than 5,000 years ago, according to the National Mango Board.In Indian culture, mango leaves are hung during special ceremonies at entrances and in temples to welcome love, good fortune and prosperity.<br><br><br><hr>
<h3>Which country mango is best in the world?</h3><hr>
<h4>INDIA</h4>
<p>India is the leading mango producer in the world, producing an estimated 24.7 million tons of mangos annually. This number accounts for almost half of the entire global mango production. Although the mangos are grown and harvested in India, very few of the mangos are distributed in the worldwide market. Less than 1% of the total mangos grown are released for international trade or sale. India is the leading consumer of mangos worldwide and consumes most of the mangos it produces.</p>
<h4>INDONESIA</h4>
<P>Indonesia is the second-leading mango producer in the world. Every year, Indonesia produces about 3.6 million tons of Mangos. The ideal climate and ample farmland to cultivate and harvest the crops in Indonesia lend themselves to being a world power in mango production. Although Indonesia produces far fewer mangos than India, it exports and ships more mangos than any other country</P>
